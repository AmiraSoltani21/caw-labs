    <h2>Briefe history</h2>
    <p><b>The</b> region of <strong>Palestine</strong> is part of the wider region of the Levant, which represents the land bridge between <b>Africa and Eurasia</b>.The areas of the Levant traditionally serve as the  <b>crossroads of Western Asia, the Eastern Mediterranean, and Northeast Africa"</b>, and in tectonic terms are located in the <b> "northwest of the Arabian Plate" </b>. <strong>Palestine </strong>itself was among the <em>earliest regions</em>to see <em>human habitation</em>, <em>agricultural communities and civilization</em>. Because of its location, it has historically been seen as a crossroads for religion, culture, commerce, and politics</p>
    <p><b>In</b> the Bronze Age, the Canaanites established city-states influenced by surrounding civilizations, among them Egypt, which ruled the area in the Late Bronze Age. During the Iron Age, two related Israelite kingdoms, Israel and Judah, controlled much of <strong>Palestine</strong>, while the Philistines occupied its southern coast. The Assyrians conquered the region in the <em>8th century BCE</em>, then the Babylonians <em>601 BCE </em>, followed by the Persian Achaemenid Empire that conquered the Babylonian Empire in <em> 539 BCE</em>. Alexander the Great conquered the Persian Empire in the late <em>330s BCE</em>, beginning Hellenization.</p>
    <p><b>After</b> the war, only two parts of <strong>Palestine</strong>remained in Arab control: the West Bank and East Jerusalem were annexed by <b>Jordan</b>, and the <b>Gaza</b> Strip was occupied by <b>Egypt , which were conquered by Israel during the Six-Day War in <b>1967</b>. Despite international objections, Israel started to establish settlements in these occupied territories. </p>
